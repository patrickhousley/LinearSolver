# Linear Solver <TI-83 Plus Basic App>
This is an old basic application I wrote for my TI-83 Plus while I was in high
school. The purpose of this application is to take solve linear equations.

The original release of the soure code can be found [here](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/75/7531.html).

You can use [this](https://www.cemetech.net/sc/) to view and modify the program.
